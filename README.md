## Water-Leaker-Sensor-Esp8266-MQTT-Telegram

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Water-Leaker-Sensor IoT project! This project aims to provide real-time monitoring of water levels and water presence using ESP8266, Arduino, and MQTT integration.

### Key Features:

- Monitoring water level using a water level sensor
- Detecting water presence through a digital sensor
- Integrating with an MQTT server for data transmission
- Telegram bot integration for monitoring and alerts

### Project Components:

- **Hardware**: Utilizes ESP8266WiFi module with water and digital sensors
- **Software**: Written in C++ using Arduino IDE, utilizing libraries like ArduinoJson, PubSubClient, and FastBot

### Functionalities:

- **Data Monitoring**: Provides real-time readings of water levels and water presence
- **MQTT Integration**: Communicates with the MQTT server for data transmission
- **Telegram Bot**: Sends alerts and status updates to users via Telegram bot

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the necessary hardware components
3. Configure the Wi-Fi and MQTT server settings in the code
4. Upload the code to your ESP8266 device
5. Monitor water levels and presence using the provided functionalities
